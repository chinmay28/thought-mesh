# Changelog

Release notes, newest first. The release workflow
(`.github/workflows/release.yml`) publishes the `## <tag>` section matching the
pushed tag as that release's body — keep the format:

```
## v0.1.42 — short title

- bullet points
```

## Unreleased

- Initial implementation: Go server over a markdown vault (wikilinks,
  backlinks, rename-with-rewrite, search, graph) + installable PWA client
  (editor with `[[` autocomplete, linked mentions, graph view, daily notes),
  CountRoster-style versioning, quickstart installer and release workflow.
