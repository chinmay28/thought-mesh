// Package version carries the application version.
//
// The scheme is calendar-based: vYEAR.MONTH.PATCH, where the patch number is
// the repository's commit count — every commit is a patch release, so
// `v2026.8.311` is the 311th commit on the 2026.8 line. The month is written
// as a plain number, not zero-padded: that keeps the string valid semver, which
// forbids a leading zero, and nothing here orders versions by sorting text.
//
// Year and Month are declared here in source and bumped by hand when a release
// line opens — deliberately not read from the build clock, which would move the
// version without a commit and make a rebuild of an old tree disagree with what
// it originally shipped. The patch number can only come from git, which a
// compiled binary has no access to, so it is stamped at link time instead:
//
//	go build -ldflags "-X github.com/chinmay28/thought-mesh/server/internal/version.Patch=$(git rev-list --count HEAD)"
//
// `npm run build` (and `build:server`) does this for you via scripts/version.mjs,
// which is also what the web client's build reads Year/Month from — keep the
// two constants below in a form that file's regex can still find.
