/**
 * The one place the app's version number is assembled.
 *
 * Scheme: vYEAR.MONTH.PATCH — a calendar version, where PATCH is the
 * repository's commit count, so `v2026.8.311` is the 311th commit on the 2026.8
 * line. The month is not zero-padded; that keeps the string valid semver.
 *
 *   - YEAR/MONTH are source constants, read out of
 *     server/internal/version/version.go so there is exactly one declaration
 *     of them in the tree. Bump them there when a release line opens; they are
 *     not taken from the build clock, which would move the version without a
 *     commit.
 *   - PATCH comes from `git rev-list --count HEAD`, which only exists at build
 *     time: the Go binary gets it stamped in via -ldflags, the web bundle gets
 *     it inlined by Vite. Both call this file, so they can never disagree.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/version.mjs            # print e.g. v2026.8.311
 *   node scripts/version.mjs --patch    # print just the commit count (311)
 *   import { appVersion } from './scripts/version.mjs'

 * Shallow is the trap, and it's why this isn't a bare `rev-list`: a clone made
 * with `--depth 1` answers `rev-list --count HEAD` with `1`, which is not an
 * error and not obviously wrong — it just quietly ships a build calling itself

 * matches the Go default), and a version ending in `.0` is visibly a
 * non-release rather than a plausible lie.
 *
 * Anything building a release therefore needs the full commit graph:
 * `fetch-depth: 0` on GitHub Actions, `--filter=blob:none` rather than
 * `--depth 1` for a cheap clone that still carries all of it.
